# Final project web app, Programming for Cloud Computing

The starter code for the final project for the Programming for
Cloud Computing course, Spring 2021

The HTML code should be complete and functional as is.

The JavaScript code is largely complete, but there are two
important sections with functions that you need to fill in:

- You need to fill in all the jQuery Ajax calls that perform
  the HTTP requests (i.e., call your Lambda functions)
- You need to do a couple of the functions that display various
  information in the HTML.

If you search for "FILL THIS IN" you should find the relevant
bits you have to do, and there should be comments in the code
that provide guidance on what needs to happen there.
